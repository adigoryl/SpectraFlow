Brief description of your project.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Conda installed on your system. You can install either Miniconda or Anaconda:

- [Miniconda installation guide](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
- [Anaconda installation guide](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

### Setting Up the Environment

#### Option 1: Using `spectraflow_env.yml`

To recreate the Conda environment with all necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to create the environment:

```bash
conda env create -f spectraflow_env.yml
```

4. Once the environment is created, activate it:

```bash
conda activate spectraflow
```

#### Option 2: Using `requirements.txt`

If you prefer to use a virtual environment and install the core libraries without Conda, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python and `pip` installed on your system.
2. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv myenv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:
```cmd
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

- On Unix or MacOS:
```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

4. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Project

Provide instructions on how to run your project after setting up the environment.
